# Perfect Utilities

In addition to the core Web Service-related functionality, Perfect provides a range of fundamental building blocks with which to build server side and desktop applications.

Like the JSON library discussed in previous chapters, many of these functions can be achieved by Swift's provided functions, however Perfect's APIs are aimed at increasing the end-user's efficiency, readibility and simplicity of code.
