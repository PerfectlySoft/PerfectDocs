# Swift ORM: "StORM"

StORM is a modular ORM for Swift, layered on top of [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect)

It aims to be easy to use, but flexible, and maintain consistency between datasource implementations for the user: you, the developer. 

Drawing on previous experiences, whether they be good, bad or ugly, of other ORM's, it tries to allow you write great code without worrying about the details of how to interact with the database.

The general StORM documentation is here: 

Datasource specific documentation for StORM:

* [SQLite3](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectDocs/blob/master/guide/StORM-SQLite.md)
* [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectDocs/blob/master/guide/StORM-PostgreSQL.md)
* [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectDocs/blob/master/guide/StORM-MySQL.md)


### Including in your project

When including the dependancy in your project's Package.swift dependancies, you will have access to all nested dependancies including the database connector.

For example to include PostgresStORM:

``` swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftORM/Postgres-Storm.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 0)
```

For example to include MySQLStORM:

``` swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftORM/MySQL-Storm.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 0)
```

To include SQLiteStORM:

``` swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftORM/SQLite-StORM.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 0)
```

Remember after you change your `Package.swift` file, you need to regenerate your Xcode Project file using:

```
swift package generate-xcodeproj 
```
